#### `longest series`
- **longest substring without repeating characters**: Use hashmap to map characters to their indices.

#### `palindrome series`
- **longest palindromic substring**
    - Maximum common substring between reversed string (some tweak) - Dynamic programming
    - Dynamic programming: p(i,j) if string(i,j) is palindrome
    - Expand around center: be careful of even length palindrome
    - Manacher algorithm

## Stack

    - **binary tree post-order traversal**: opposite of binary tree pre-order traversal. Use two stacks. Dot graph when only one stack allowed.

    - **binary tree level order traversal II**: BFS using queue.
    - **binary tree zig-zag level order traversal**: BFS using stack.
    - **populating next right pointers in each node II and II**: very special level order traversal. Need to keep track of this level's node, and next level's last visited node. This level can be visited by using this level's node's next.
    - **binary tree right side view**: level order traversal find the last node of every level


#### `construct tree`
- **construct binary tree from preorder and inorder traversal**: pre-order starts with root

- **pass down**
    - **validate binary search tree**: can pass down min and max. Don't have to return them. Also, be careful of minimum and maximum values of integer.

# MISC

- Java `int` can not be null. `Integer` is nullable. `Collection` contains `objects`.
- Good practice to use generic forms?
    - `Set<T> foo = new HashSet<T>();`
    - `Map<Character, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();`
